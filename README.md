## Meedan UI

A team reference for UI production techniques and build processes.

See the 'projects' directory. 

Each project is self-contained and self-documenting.

## Quick start 

    `npm install -g rnpm` # install rnpm
    `rnpm install` # to install the dependencies
    `cd project/PROJECTNAME && gulp` # to start the compiler

 install the packages with rnpm (`rnpm install`) [1] because some of the projects contain duplicate packages. (rnpm helps reduce the number of installed packages.)
