                <p>In a country where rumors and unverified media fly around Facebook and Twitter, print offers a path to legitimacy for the media company, founded in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>One of Checkdesk&rsquo;s most active partners, Welad el Balad has founded 10 local newsrooms across Egypt, each of which publish their own weekly paper. Additionally, they run a national online aggregator in partnership with leading portal Masrawy that covers 20 governorates.
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;Welad El Balad was set up in 2012 with a mission to give communities access to skills and outlets that allow them to take ownership of media production at the local level,&rdquo; noted Fatemah Farag, Founder and Director at Welad El Balad.
                </p>
                <p>Making that mission a reality requires a lot of work&mdash;two shifts a day, seven days a week, starting at 8:30 am and running till nearly midnight. The newsrooms coordinate using Google Drive, email, chat, Facebook and telephone. In the flurry of messages, Checkdesk plays a critical role.

                    <p>&ldquo;For our trainees in Egypt&rsquo;s governorates,&rdquo; explained Farag, &ldquo;the training has been key as well as developing the fact checking nature of the platform.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;What is legitimate, what is credible, is print,&rdquo; noted Fatemah Farag, Executive Editor, in a <a href="http://www.editorsweblog.org/2012/09/12/welad-el-balad-introducing-hyperlocal-in-post-revolution-egypt">recent interview</a>. And behind that credibility is ensuring that the facts they report are verified and accurate.
                </p>
                <p>Farag and her team began using Checkdesk in 2013, and formed <a href="http://yomaty.net">Yomaty.net</a>. Tested in Cario and cities across Egypt, Yomaty has been used to investigate many rumors spreading via social media, in particular related to the ongoing transition from Muslim Brotherhood rule to the presidency of Abdelfattah El-Sisi.
                </p>
                <p>Checkdesk&rsquo;s viability rests not just on software but on training, and training has played a central role in Yomaty&rsquo;s implementation. In 2013 alone, Welad led trainings in 7 governorates with over 800 students of journalism. They also implemented an internship program focused on the Hani Darwish Citizen Journalism Prize, which honors outstanding trainees that demonstrated advanced proficiencies in verification techniques and citizen journalism.

                        Yomaty's Checkdesk is a shield for our community against rumors and fake news; it's a way to build trust between readers and news-makers. For more than 10 months we have played a major role in fact checking important news events, like election campaigns and coverage of Egypt's recent presidential elections. We've also verified statements attributed to well-known people while uncovering many fake social media accounts claiming to represent them.
