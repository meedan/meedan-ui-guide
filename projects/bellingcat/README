## Bellingcat refactor of the Checkdesk Sass

This is a meedan-ui-support project, e.g., a sandbox for experimental things with CSS, HTML and JS. See the parent `../README`.

This project uses bower, grunt and npm.

## Purpose of this project

The main idea here is to have a safe space to make improvements to the [Checkdesk][http://checkdesk.org] theme. Also: to improve the developer experience.

- improved mobile support (improved source ordering, mobile first)
- slimmer output CSS 
- better live-reloading
- better automated cross-browser testing — eg with Sauce Labs
- better Sass testing — eg with boilerplate
- faster Sass compile-reloading — move to LibSass
- more stable live-reloading — grunt plugin, browser plugin, (takana?)
- better docs 

## Quick start

    . Snapshot of the HTML from the live site.
    . Edit the CSS to use the local styles.scss.
    . Remove the google analytics
    . compile the Sass, see the parent `../README`.

## TODOS

- Automate the HTML snapshot, if it is working well     
- More analysis of the codebase, some kind of logging or stats?
