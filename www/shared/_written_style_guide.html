    <h3>What is Meedan?</h3>
    <p>We are a hybrid for-profit and non-profit. For the purposes of the majority of our external communications, we identify as a single entity, called “Meedan”. As needed for legal purposes (including for grants and fundraising), we do clarify our hybrid nature.</p>
    <p>The new logo represents the next step in Meedan’s evolution as a company, from a technology nonprofit focused on the Middle East North Africa region to a hybrid nonprofit and for-profit that supports global journalism and civic engagement.</p>
    <p>The circular logo took inspiration from the Arabic word meedan which refers to a circular space of gathering from traditional city planning in the Arab world. The new logo draws from the color themes of the circle, while emphasizing connection and unity across the divides. in this sentence, the word meedan now refers to the Indo-European word whose root meaning refers to a place of gathering in a civic arena. The word appears in Arabic, Ukrainian, Hindi, Farsi, Urdu and many other languages. We now think of the meedan on a global context, as a place of gathering in the great global civic space of the internet.</p>
    <p>The above may change pending a security review by Meedan’s Egyptian team.</p>

    <h3>Core Values </h3>
    <p>Meedan’s core values reflect the guiding principles under which we operate. They identify how we work as a company, both for outside collaborators to understand and, more importantly, for all team members across the company. We choose to work in the digital world, because that is the world where these new values take root. We sit in front of a keyboard that connects us to the translated writing of a poet in Argentina. In the same moment we share that with colleagues in Cairo. After millenia spent mapping our imagined geography of the world, we are, are just two decades of the Internet, able to source, share, and weave ideas, inspiration, and information across the world in minutes. </p>
