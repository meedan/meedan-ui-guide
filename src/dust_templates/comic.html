    <h3>1. Stack Building Scenario</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="clarice--happy">
        <p>This guy Paul is walking around the planet. I want to translate all the stuff near him. I create a spreadsheet of all the things I want translated. Like this: </p>

        <table>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>URL</th>
          <th>Source</th>
          <th>Lang</th>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>twitter.com/post/1</td>
            <td>"Hi this is my first tweet!"</td>
            <td>en</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>twitter.com/post/2</td>
            <td>"... and my second tweet!"</td>
            <td>en</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>twitter.com/post/3</td>
            <td>"Wow this is my THIRD tweet!"</td>
            <td>en</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

      </li>

      <li class="clarice--happy">
        <p>The spreadsheet is our private <a href="#stack">stack</a> of work-jobs for translators ... I add things to the stack in various ways — I usually add small bits of social media content.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="clarice--happy">
        <p>Each row in the spreadsheet is a job that a translator can perform. When I find something I want translated, I add it to the spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3>2. Stacks: Tre finds translation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="tre--happy">
        <p>Before you can translate something, you have to find something worth translating. For now we just do this with Gdocs.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- <li>[SPREADSHEET]</li> -->
      <li class="tre--happy">
        <p>So, because I have a gmail address, Clarice just invited me to this spreadsheet. Each row is a tweet that could be translated.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="tre--happy">
        <p>In this spreadsheet, not everything needs to be translated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You just choose which one you want to work on by clicking a link in the row.</p>
      </li>

    <h3>3. Editing: Tre is translating</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="tre--happy">
        <p>After I <a href="">signed up</a> and <a href="">logged in</a> and <a href="">chosen some work</a> ... I get into this editor. It's pretty simple. I create the translation and click done.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="tre--working">
        <p>I see here I can use some
          <em>basic support tools</em>... Then I just type the translation out, and maybe read it out loud to myself ...</p>
      </li>

      <li class="tre--confused">
        <p>I click "done" ... and Clarice gets it. Usually that is the last I see of the translation job, but sometimes Clarice the Client does a <a href="">review</a> of my work.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Embedding: Clarice publishes her Stack</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="clarice--happy">
        <span class="pain-point">It's hard to read the spreadsheet.</span>
        <p>Once all of the translations are done by translators like Tre .. I go to my stack page and there is this little embed button ... When I click it I get these simple options for how to embed the stack.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- <li>[EMBED BUTTON]</li> -->

      <li class="clarice--happy">
        <span class="pain-point">The embed is not very easy to read.</span>
        <p>I get the embed code and I know the embed will always look like what I am seeing here. The embed is really simple one-column view that works almost anywhere.
          <em>I am presenting the result of our curation and translation.</em>

    <h3>5. Getting Help</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="tre--happy clarice--happy">
        <p>Sometimes as a translator I need guidelines and help. For now, I just use this PDF that they sent me.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="tre--happy clarice--happy">
        <p>I exchange a few emails a month with Clarice directly. She gives me everything I need to know!</p>
